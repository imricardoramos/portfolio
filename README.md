# Portfolio
Hi ðŸ‘‹, this is the place where I'm leaving some of the projects things I've done over time.
So far there aren't that many, but the idea in most projects is to try to include many of the things you would expect from a full project, which normally include:
1. Codebase
2. Background jobs
3. Environment Configurations for Dev, Test and/or Prod
4. Containerized Applications
5. Testing
6. CI/CD deployment
